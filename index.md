## Design Manifesto
By Dan DiIorio

Anyone can watch a YouTube video or do a Google search about the design process, and see what long-time professionals have to say about design. But the design process is not that simple. It is personalized, ever-changing, and weird. How any one person goes about designing something for anything is different from the next person.

This site is to show my own personal design process, and with it examples of when it has worked, failed, or helped me improve.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/drd387/design-manifesto/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
