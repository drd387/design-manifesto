## My Personal Design Process
By Dan DiIorio 

Anyone can watch a YouTube video or do a Google search about the design process, and see what long-time professionals have to say about design. But the design process is not that simple. It is personalized, ever-changing, and weird. How any one person goes about designing something for anything is different from the next person.

This site is to show my own personal design process, and with it examples of when it has worked, failed, or helped me improve.

### Brainstorming

Brainstorming is a pretty simple concept - have an idea of what you want to accomplish, and generate ideas that would make that possible. Generally, it's easiest to think of as many ideas as possible, so as to be able to rule out and learn from bad ones so that eventually you'll find a good one.

Here is a great example of a brainstorming board that one of my groups put together. I chose this one because it shows how it doesn't have to be formal and not everything has to be useful, but as long as ideas are getting put onto paper then the brainstorming has been successful.

It's easy to see that there's pretty basic ideas among fairly complex ideas, useless drawing, and snippets of text in there, but that brainstorming paper was probably the most helpful one that I have had during this class.

### Refining

Ideas are just that - ideas. Without refining these ideas, all that's there is what you'd _want_ there to be. 

Once brainstorming is done with, it's time to choose that one idea that you'll eventually develop into the final product. This idea doesn't have to be one concrete idea from brainstorming; it can be a mixture of good ones, or even something totally new that you've come up with after learning from really terrible ideas that you forced yourself to come up with. Either way, the goal is to have something that you decide you will definitely be working on. 

Below is a ridiculously complex flow chart for a chatbot that talks to the user about whether or not artificial intelligence is going to take over the world. The idea with this chart is that as a group, we decided on a topic, thought about how we were going to go about delivering to the user, and ultimately developed a flowchart for a bot that we had yet to build.

One downfall of my design process so far is that in using this method, we tended towards groupthink, and stopped producing new ideas. We were set into the production of this chart so much so that it was almost not worth it to then say something like "Hey, maybe we should add _this_ topic in". Overall, I'd say that project was a great success, users liked the light-heartedness of the bot, and its playing of the devil's advocate, but it was not without its failings. 

Lastly, this step is critical. It is the point of no return (unless you're designing for fun or for a boss that really has no idea what a deadline is). Past this point in the design process, I am set on what I want to accomplish and how I am going to go about doing it.

### Final Production

The biggest challenge of doing anything is, by definition, doing it. After all the buildup, the only thing left to do is build the product.

The final product is what gets delivered to the user. Users then can be unhappy, happy, ambivalent, etc. Because of this, two things are important to follow preceding actually finishing and delivering your finished project. These are user testing and taking feedback.

### 1. User Testing

If the user wants this product bad enough, and you care about it enough, then you'll absolutely want to do some user testing. 

The user never knows what to change to make it better, but they always know what's wrong. Keeping this in mind, listen to feedback from users. They might suggest changes or complain about that bug you totally thought you fixed, but everything they say might be useful. If, for example, a user says "This should be green, not blue", maybe green isn't the color you should choose, but the fact that the user doesen't like what you have in terms of color means that your color scheme needs work. 

That is, of course, a simplified version of user testing; in reality, problems are much more complex and require more time and effort to fix, but that's why you're designing in the first place: to fix a problem or add some sort of funtionality to someone's life.

### 2. Taking Feedback

Ultimately, your vision of a product is probably not the same as a user's vision of the same product. Because of this, it's the designer's role to take both visions and compromise. Take good ideas from both, meld them together, and finally try to satisfy the user as well as yourself.

A useful tool for feedback is Stanford University's "I like, I wish, What if..." method. Though it sounds pretty passive-aggressive, (and absolutely can be) used correctly, it can be a very powerful tool. During the course of this class everyone used it at least 7 or 8 times to deliver feedback to other classmate's projects. 

Essentially, a user testing a project should give one good thing they liked about the product (I like), one thing they didn't like (I wish), and one thing they might change (What if). Using this information, a designer can more easily determine the faults in their product, and what they might want to change.

### My Own Projects

Finally, here are some of my own projects that I have worked on, and written about with my time in this class.

[Travel-the-World](https://medium.com/design-for-another-worldgroup-3/design-for-another-world-c2c25441c15e), a VR website made to give users an experience they may rarely, if ever, get to see.

[Design for Others](https://medium.com/@dannyd40/design-doc-for-design-for-others-ea7917c54677), a redesign of the Worcester Public Library's website, focused on parents of children aged 3-10.

[Jarvis, the Chatbot](https://medium.com/@justinkreiselman/design-for-tension-13bd6d196512), a chatbot meant to provide a user with opposing arguments and ideas regarding artifical intelligence.

[Try Not to Laugh](https://medium.com/@robertharrison43/design-for-well-being-c6e36c045b03), a website that reads your emotions, and can tell when you've lost the "Try Not to Laugh" challenge.
