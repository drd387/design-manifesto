## Design Manifesto
By Dan DiIorio

Anyone can watch a YouTube video or do a Google search about the design process, and see what long-time professionals have to say about design. But the design process is not that simple. It is personalized, ever-changing, and weird. How any one person goes about designing something for anything is different from the next person.

This site is to show my own personal design process, and with it examples of when it has worked, failed, or helped me improve.

### Brainstorming

Brainstorming is a pretty simple concept - have an idea of what you want to accomplish, and generate ideas that would make that possible. Generally, it's easiest to think of as many ideas as possible, so as to be able to rule out and learn from bad ones so that eventually you'll find a good one.

Here is a great example of a brainstorming board that one of my groups put together. I chose this one because it shows how it doesn't have to be formal and not everything has to be useful, but as long as ideas are getting put onto paper then the brainstorming has been successful.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/drd387/design-manifesto/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
